# Project Description

## Industry trends
Electric vehicles are increasing in number over the recent years. In April 2016, ridesharing company Teo Taxi launched a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) fleet followed four months later by
Uber. In 2020 Volkswagen starts a fully-electric carsharing platform, whereas other companies such as BMW already provide such a service. When driven, an electric vehicle garners profit for the platform through transportation. When parked, it can act as a controllable storage device either consuming surplus or injecting energy to the grid. Hence, managed PEV fleets provide unique grid-support opportunities, and added profits to the platform through vehicle-to-grid services.

## Vehicle-to-Grid services
Therefore, electric vehicles are interesting from an engineering perspective since, among other viewpoints, they can be viewed
as mobile batteries. The electric energy which they can provide or absorb by charging and discharging their batteries gives rise to new possibilities for the electrical power system, such as frequency regulation and peak shaving using electric vehicles, services commonly referred to as vehicle-to-grid services.  

## Sharing economy business models
Business models which traditionally focused on the transportation sector can benefit from the added electrical energy functionalities of an electric vehicle. For example, transportation sharing economy business models such as car- and ridesharing may utilize electric vehicles to gain an extra revenue stream, by offering vehicle-to-grid services. This work focuses on the aforementioned case. and analyzes the interaction between each of two types of sharing economy business models namely ride- and carsharing, their users or customers, and the receiver of their vehicle-to-grid services. In the first model the platform has transactional control over the vehicles, that is, private drivers respond to monetary incentives. On the other hand, the second model directly controls its fleet. This work develops a mathematical framework to analyze the aforementioned models through queuing theory. 

## Goal of this work
It characterizes viable control strategies for the platforms to co-optimize their revenues from both transportation and grid services. It develops profit maximization algorithms of the PEV fleet managers providing such services. Finally, variables of interest are plotted as a function of various platform parameters.
